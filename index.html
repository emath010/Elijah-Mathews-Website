        <div class="subheading mb-5">SociologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Elijah Mathews is currently studying Sociology, focusing on a research path in the field of Sociology where he wishes to join a research group at either a research facility outside of or located within a college campus.<br><br>

        Deeply interested in the process of research and the scientific method involved in sociological research, Elijah seeks to gain a foothold in the profession field via seeking research opportunities at his school, the University of California Riverside. Elijah plans on becoming involved and taking advantage of various research opportunities offered by professors of the University as well as outside internships seeking interns. With these goals, he intends to break into the field of research sociology in which he may work with both large and smaller entities and their data.<br><br>

        Elijah wishes to study various sociological subjects, including the vast social effects the COVID-19 pandemic and the global lockdown measures taken by most world governments in their own implementation have affected both the wider populace and the individual. The COVID-19 Pandemic has been an unprecedented event in world history with sociological and psychological effects in which never have been fully analyzed and processed before. He also wishes to study the effects of living under an authoritarian regime on it's society. Inspired by recent developments across the world such as Russian society under over twenty years of authoritarian rule under Putin's control, and most recently the victory of former dictator of the Philippine's son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Further in depth, he would like to analyze and research the effects that populist rhetoric effects a society's functioning and views on both cultural, labor, and political issues as a whole such as most recently the former presidency of Donald Trump in the United States. In the following years of various populist regimes, there have been evidence of both social and political unrest, and Elijah is interested in these subjects in research sociology. Drawing on from his interest in political subjects and their effects on their societies, Elijah also plans on either minoring or double-majoring in Political Science, with the interest of public policy and working with data for policies going hand in hand with Sociological research. Aside from research related to political regimes and other related subjects, Elijah wishes to also research the effects of social media on society and the history of social media and it's effects on society, focusing on the United States. Dating back to as early the late 90s and the advent of the Dot Com bubble, the internet has had a sizeable influence on both the popular culture and social aspects of American society, and analyzing this from a Sociological perspective calls for a brief history on the developments of the early internet, it's expansion, it's metamorphosis, and it's current state. The internet and social media by a large extent have grown to have a massive influence on the social fabric of the United States, and ultiately the world as a whole, and has forever chagned how humans interact. Research into the effects of this revolutionary technology and it's effects on global society would be largely beneficial to the coming future that seeks to expand upon these technologies, and further changing how societies interact with each other.<br><br>
